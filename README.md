so my game is called ball shooter. there are two ball which called object and shooter.
The object will randomly refresh at the top of the screen and fall down, you need to control the shooter to shoot the laser to hit the object.
if you hit it, you will get one point, and the object will refresh again at the top of the screen, if you miss, the object eventually falls to the bottom.
you will lose two points. At the same time, the object will also refresh at the top of the screen. If you get 10 points, "you win" will be displayed.
If you get -10 points, "you lose" will be displayed.
the way to control the shooter is pretty simple, use A to let shooter keep go left and D let shooter keep go right, use  up arrow to lase, and down arrow to let lase disappear

and if the game is end(win or lose), it will show check to restart, if you press left at mouse, the game will restart, and you can play again
note: if you let the ray keep forever, Slamming him directly into an object will not score any points, you need to press down arrow first, aim and then use up arrow again
